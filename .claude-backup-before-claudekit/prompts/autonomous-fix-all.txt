# Autonomous Fix All Errors Template

Use this prompt to let Claude fix all errors autonomously:

---

Fix all errors in [PROJECT/SERVICE] autonomously:

1. Scan for all TypeScript/ESLint errors
2. Fix each error one by one
3. After each fix, run: npm test
4. If tests fail: analyze, fix, and retry
5. If tests pass: continue to next error
6. Repeat until all errors fixed and all tests pass
7. Provide summary report at the end

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT ask for approval on each edit
- Work autonomously
- Fix issues as you encounter them
- Be thorough and test everything

Start now and work until complete!
