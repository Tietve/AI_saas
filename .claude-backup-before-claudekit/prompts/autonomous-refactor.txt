# Autonomous Refactoring Template

Use this for autonomous refactoring tasks:

---

Refactor [COMPONENT/SERVICE] autonomously to [GOAL]:

## Current State:
[Describe current implementation]

## Desired State:
[Describe target architecture/pattern]

## Refactoring Steps:
1. Analyze current code structure
2. Create refactoring plan
3. Make changes incrementally:
   - Refactor one function/file at a time
   - Run tests after each change
   - If tests fail: revert, adjust approach, retry
   - If tests pass: commit mentally and continue
4. Update all usages/references
5. Update tests if needed
6. Run full test suite
7. Clean up (remove old code, unused imports)

## Autonomous Mode Rules:
- Work systematically
- Test after each significant change
- Fix issues immediately when found
- Don't skip steps
- Be thorough
- Report progress every 10 changes

Continue autonomously until refactoring is complete!
