# Autonomous TDD (Test-Driven Development) Template

Use this for TDD autonomous implementation:

---

Implement [FEATURE] using Test-Driven Development autonomously:

## TDD Cycle (repeat for each requirement):

### Red Phase:
1. Write a failing test for one requirement
2. Run test to confirm it fails
3. Document what the test expects

### Green Phase:
1. Write minimal code to make test pass
2. Run test
3. If fails: adjust code and retry
4. If passes: proceed to refactor

### Refactor Phase:
1. Improve code quality
2. Remove duplication
3. Apply best practices
4. Run tests again to ensure still passing

## Autonomous Rules:
- Follow TDD strictly (Red → Green → Refactor)
- Do NOT skip writing tests first
- Do NOT ask for approval between cycles
- Run tests after EVERY code change
- Fix immediately if tests break
- Continue until ALL requirements implemented

## Requirements to implement:
[List specific requirements/user stories]

Start the TDD cycle autonomously and work until all requirements are implemented with passing tests!
