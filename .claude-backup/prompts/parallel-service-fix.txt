# Parallel Service Fix Template

Use this to fix multiple services in parallel:

---

Launch [N] service-fixer agents in parallel to fix all microservices:

## Services to fix:
- Agent 1: backend/services/auth-service
- Agent 2: backend/services/chat-service
- Agent 3: backend/services/billing-service
- Agent 4: backend/services/analytics-service
- Agent 5: backend/services/email-worker

## Each agent must:
1. Scan their assigned service for all errors
2. Fix all TypeScript/ESLint errors
3. Run service tests: `cd [service] && npm test`
4. Fix any test failures
5. Report results with:
   - Number of errors fixed
   - Test pass/fail status
   - Time taken
   - Any issues encountered

## Coordination rules:
- Each agent works ONLY on their assigned service
- No cross-service dependencies
- Agents work simultaneously
- Main coordinator collects results

## Final report:
After all agents complete, provide:
- Total errors fixed across all services
- All services test status
- Total time saved vs sequential
- Any remaining issues

Launch all agents NOW and work in parallel!
