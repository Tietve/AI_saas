# Autonomous Debugging Template

Use this for autonomous bug fixing:

---

Debug and fix [BUG/ISSUE] autonomously:

## Bug Description:
[Describe the bug]

## Expected Behavior:
[What should happen]

## Actual Behavior:
[What actually happens]

## Debugging Process (autonomous):

1. **Reproduce the Bug:**
   - Set up test case
   - Run code to confirm bug exists
   - Document exact steps to reproduce

2. **Investigate Root Cause:**
   - Add logging/console statements
   - Trace execution flow
   - Identify where things go wrong
   - Analyze stack traces if available

3. **Develop Fix:**
   - Implement solution
   - Test the fix
   - If still broken: go back to step 2
   - If fixed: proceed to step 4

4. **Verify Fix:**
   - Run original test case
   - Run related test cases
   - Test edge cases
   - Ensure no regressions

5. **Clean Up:**
   - Remove debug logging
   - Add proper error handling
   - Add test case for this bug
   - Update documentation if needed

## Autonomous Rules:
- Work until bug is COMPLETELY fixed
- Don't give up after first attempt
- Add logging liberally during debug
- Clean up all debug code when done
- Document the root cause in commit message
- Add regression test

Continue debugging autonomously until issue is resolved and verified!
